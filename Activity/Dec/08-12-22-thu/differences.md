Differences between JS and Python on Arithmetic Operators.

| Sl No | Python | JavaScript |
| ----- | ------ | ---------- |
|       |        |            |
|       |        |            |

### Comments
- Single-Line Comments
    - In Python, we use a hashtag (#) to write a comment. All the characters on the same line after this symbol are considered part of the comment.
    - In JavaScript, we write two slashes (//) to start a single-line comment.

```py
In Python :
# Comment
```
```js
In JavaScript :
// Comment
```

- Multi-Line Comments
    - In Python, to write a multi-line comment we start each line with a hashtag.
    - In JavaScript, multi-line comments start with a /* and end with a */. All the characters between these symbols are considered part of the comment.

```py
In Python :
# Multi-line comment 
# in Python to explain
# the code in detail.
```
```js
In JavaScript :

/* 
Multi-line comment 
in JavaScript to explain 
the code in detail.
*/
```










- Input and Output in Python and JavaScript

Input
- In Python, we use the input() function to ask for user input. We write the message within parentheses.

- In JavaScript, one alternative (if you are running the code on a browser) is to display a small prompt with window.prompt(message) and assign the result to a variable.
  
The main difference between these two approaches is that in Python, the user will be prompted to enter a value in the console while in JavaScript, a small prompt will be displayed on the browser and it will ask the user to enter a value.
