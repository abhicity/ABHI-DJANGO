### Exercise Questions

# 2. A train travels 3,000 meters in 9000 seconds. Write a program to find the speed of the train.




distance = 3000 # distance in kilometers
seconds = 9000 # time in seconds

average_speed = distance / seconds # average speed in kilometers per seconds
print(average_speed, "km/sec")
#OP 0.3333333333333333 km/sec








#      9000 seconds = 150 minutes

#distance = 3000 # distance in kilometers
#minutes = 150 # time in minutes

#average_speed = distance / minutes # average speed in kilometers per minutes
#print(average_speed, "km/min")
