### Exercise Questions

1. Write a program that calculates the number of seconds in a day. [open](folder/eq1.py)
2. A train travels 3,000 meters in 9000 seconds. Write a program to find the speed of the train. [open](folder/eq2.py)
3. Write a program to read the marks of three subjects and find the average of them. [open](folder/eq3.py)
4. Write a program to read two integers and perform arithmetic operations on them
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, Modules, floor division ). [open](folder/eq4.py)

### String

1. Differentiate between the following. [open](folder/str1.md)
    a. isidintifier() and isnumeric()
    b. find() and casefold()
    c. split() and splitlines()


2. Write a function called rotate_word that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and that function should return a new string containing the letters from the original string “rotated” by the given amount. For example, “cheer” rotated by 7 is “jolly” and “melon” rotated by −10 is “cubed”.

EG:
cheer => ROTATED 7 TIMES => jolly

c ==> rotate by 7 ==> j
h ==> rotate by 7 ==> o
o ==> rotate by 7 ==> l

count letters from c to j it is 7
count letters from h to o it is 7 [open](folder/str2.py)

3.  Ask the user for a string, and then for a number. Print out that string, that many times. (For example, if the string is Python and the number is 3 you should print out PythonPythonPython.) [open](folder/str3.py)


4.  Write a program that parses a binary number to a decimal integer. For example, 11001 (1 * 24 + 1 * 23 + 0 * 22 + 0 * 21 + 1 * 20). [open](folder/str4.py)


5.  Write a program that accepts a string from the user and display the same string after removing vowels from it. [open](folder/str5.py)


6.  Write a function to insert a string in the middle of the string. [open](folder/str6.py)


## List
