### 1. Variables
```
// Variable x in JavaScript
let x = 2;
# Variable x in Python
x = 2  #no keyword needed, can't start with number, no space or dash
```
---
### 2. Strings
In both languages, strings are identified by quotes (single or double).
```
// JavaScript
let str = 'Hello World!'; // sing or double quotes work
# Python
str = 'Hello World!' # single or double quotes work
```
---
### 3. Numbers
In JavaScript, numbers can be integers or floats (have decimals). In Python an integer is a specific number type and a float is another specific number type.
```
// JavaScript
let x = 1    // number
let y = 1.2  // number
# Python
x = 1     # integer
y = 1.2   # float
```
---
### 4. Boolean
In both languages booleans exist, but in Python the boolean must be capitalized.
```
// JavaScript
let bool1 = true;
let bool2 = false;
# Python
bool1 = True    # must be capitalized
bool2 = False   # must be capitalized
```
---
### 5. Arrays (or Lists in Python)
In JavaScript, arrays are ordered list of (can be, but not necessary) various data types housed in brackets ([]). Python also has an ordered list of (can be, but not necessary) various data types houses in brackets ([]), but they are called lists.
```
// JavaScript
let arr = [ 1, 'two', true ];
# Python
list = [ 1, 'two', true ]
```
